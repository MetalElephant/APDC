# Land It!

[Land It!](https://landit-app.appspot.com) is being made for the course Activity for Curricular Development taught at [NOVA School of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en).

It is being accomplished under the guidance of the professors [Carlos Damásio](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/pessoas/docentes/carlos-augusto-isaac-pilo-viegas-damasio), [Henrique Domingos](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/pessoas/docentes/henrique-joao-lopes-domingos), [João Leitão](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/pessoas/docentes/joao-leitao) and [Pedro Medeiros](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/pessoas/docentes/pedro-abilio-duarte-de-medeiros).

## Description

Due to an increase in rural desertification, there have been fewer people left to manage the interior territories (in Portugal), which can lead to an increase in forest fires  & undocumented land. Therefore, our main goal is to help municipalities more easily manage those aspects, leaning on voluntary help from land owners.

Since we know it's hard to get your "everyday Joe" interested in this subject, we are hoping to partner with local merchants (local to each municipality) to reward our users through a refer-a-friend and point system, where they would be able to redeem products the merchants choose to give out as rewards.
